# players

This program was developed to solve the following exercise:

1. create 2 Player instances
2. one of the players should send a message to second player (let's call this player "initiator")
3. when a player receives a message, it should reply with a message that contains the received message concatenated with the value of a counter holding the number of messages this player already sent.
4. finalize the program (gracefully) after the initiator sent 10 messages and received back 10 messages (stop condition)
5. both players should run in the same java process (strong requirement)
6. document for every class the responsibilities it has.
